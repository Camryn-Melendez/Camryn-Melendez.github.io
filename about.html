                This website was created in Visual Studio code, written in HTML and CSS I self taught myself
                from the internet. I started coding at the beginning of my freshman year at Northeastern and 
                haven't stopped since. I have too many unanswered questions... there is no time to waste!

                    In all seriousness, I an aspiring software developer with a passion for art and design. I love
                    the creativity and problem solving involved in writing programs, and I am hoping to continue
                    to grow my technical skills so that I can write more complex elegant programs in the future.
