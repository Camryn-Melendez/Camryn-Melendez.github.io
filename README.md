Personal Website/Portfolio 

I started this project in 2019 at a hackday with a Northeastern University club: Northeasten Women in Technology. This website provides a learning ground for me to explore basic front end development practices, tools, and techniques. I also use this website to display my artwork and other various coding projects.
