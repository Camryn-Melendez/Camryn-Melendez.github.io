# Personal Website Hack Day 2019! ðŸŽ‰

Ever wanted to build your own website? With NUWIT, you'll learn howâ€”and more!

## Getting Started
### Wireframing
- **[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)**: A wireframing application that can help you plan out your website! 
### Code Editors
Here are some great **open source** code editors that are compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux:
- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**: Microsoft's code editor with a super sleek user interface and terminal integration. 
- **[Atom](https://atom.io/)**: Github's code editor, also with a sleek UI and terminal integration! 

There are lots of other code editors out there if you'd prefer something different, but these two are highly recommended and completely free!

### Installing Git
Git is a **version control** system. It, like our code editors, is open source. Essentially, git allows us to make changes to code, revert code to a past version, and add features to code without necessarily having those features part of our final product.

- **[For Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)**
- **[For Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)**

### Using Git and Github ###

Open your terminal in your code editor:
- Use the `` âŒƒ` `` keyboard shortcut with the backtick character.
- Use the `View > Terminal` menu command.
- From the Command Palette (`â‡§âŒ˜P`)

Type the following command into your terminal:
```git clone https://github.com/nuwit/hack_day_2019.git```
